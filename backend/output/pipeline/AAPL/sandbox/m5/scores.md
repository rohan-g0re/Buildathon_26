| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | 6/10 |
| Feasibility | 5/10 |
| Risk Adjusted Return | 5/10 |
| Strategic Alignment | 7/10 |
| **Subtotal** | **23/40** |

*Reasoning:* The move is strategically aligned with Apple's proven Services growth engine and APAC opportunity, but impact is constrained by realistic enterprise penetration timelines (20-25% attach in mid-market is modest), and feasibility is undermined by Apple's lack of embedded IT relationships, compliance certifications, and enterprise sales infrastructure that competitors have spent a decade building. Risk-adjusted return is mediocre because the 2-year runway before 2027 regulatory margin compression is insufficient to build material revenue density, and the pilot's success doesn't guarantee scaling beyond 3-4 year horizons. This is a defensible long-term positioning play, not a near-term growth driver.

## D2

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | 5/10 |
| Feasibility | 6/10 |
| Risk Adjusted Return | 5/10 |
| Strategic Alignment | 7/10 |
| **Subtotal** | **23/40** |

*Reasoning:* The pilot is executable and strategically sound as a *secondary* test, but the original 'aggressive monetization' framing overstated impact—Services bundling in APAC will likely generate 2-4% incremental Services revenue at best, not a structural growth driver. The gated approach with stress-testing mitigates risk, but pilot bias and opportunity-cost concerns mean this should not displace hardware stabilization efforts, which have higher near-term ROI potential.

## D3

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | 6/10 |
| Feasibility | 4/10 |
| Risk Adjusted Return | 4/10 |
| Strategic Alignment | 7/10 |
| **Subtotal** | **21/40** |

*Reasoning:* The move is strategically sound—Services diversification is directionally correct and APAC enterprise is a real opportunity—but execution feasibility is severely constrained by unvalidated assumptions about enterprise attach rates, competitive positioning, and channel integration. Without win/loss testing against Microsoft/Google incumbents and clarity on sales channel strategy, the risk-adjusted return is materially lower than the initial 'low-risk' framing suggested. Impact could be significant if execution succeeds, but the probability of success remains unproven.
