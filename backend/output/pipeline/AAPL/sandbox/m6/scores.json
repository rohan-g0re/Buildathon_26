      "reasoning": "The strategy has meaningful defensive value in preventing further China market collapse (high alignment with survival imperatives), but the critic's core critique stands: a $4.5B annual hardware margin sacrifice to recover 2 points of market share and stabilize an installed base Apple could partially defend through other means is economically questionable. Feasibility is constrained by carrier control challenges and the geopolitical reality that Huawei's state backing makes price competition asymmetric. The 16% share target by Q4 2026 is testable, but the risk-adjusted return remains poor\u2014the upside (Services optionality + share stabilization) doesn't meaningfully exceed the downside (margin destruction + potential strategic distraction from higher-ROI initiatives like AI/services innovation)."

      "feasibility": 5,
      "risk_adjusted_return": 4,
      "strategic_alignment": 7,
      "reasoning": "The move has meaningful defensive value in protecting $74B in Greater China revenue, but the critic's analysis exposed that the core math doesn't work: Services can't close the margin gap, cannibalization is structurally difficult to control, and the diagnostic mechanism was poorly designed until forced to tighten it. The 12-week pilot gate I proposed salvages feasibility but costs critical time against Huawei's momentum. Strategic alignment is strong (defensive posture fits Apple's ecosystem model), but risk-adjusted return is weak because even success only delays the real question\u2014whether price or brand nationalism is the binding constraint\u2014and the downside (brand damage from false start + permanent market share loss) exceeds the upside."

      "feasibility": 5,
      "risk_adjusted_return": 4,
      "strategic_alignment": 5,
      "reasoning": "The move has meaningful potential (6/10 impact) to arrest China share loss if executed correctly, but feasibility is compromised by unresolved cannibalization unknowns and the need for a diagnostic-first approach (5/10). Risk-adjusted return is weak (4/10) because the $1.8B+ gross profit downside outweighs speculative Services offsets and competitor switcher gains without proof of 70%+ switcher rates. Strategic alignment is middling (5/10)\u2014price compression contradicts Apple's premium positioning, though defending installed base in China has long-term value if the diagnostic validates feature-driven rather than price-driven competition."
