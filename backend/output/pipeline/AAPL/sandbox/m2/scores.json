      "reasoning": "The move is strategically aligned with Services monetization but delivers only 2-3% uplift ($1.75-2.6B) against a $4-5B regulatory exposure\u2014a material shortfall that limits impact. Feasibility is moderate because tiered pricing is operationally straightforward, but elasticity assumptions are untested and customer backlash risk is real. Risk-adjusted return is weak: the upside is capped at 2-3% revenue growth while downside includes churn, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage, with no clear margin improvement once divorced from the regulatory defense rationale that originally justified it."

      "risk_adjusted_return": 4,
      "strategic_alignment": 7,
      "reasoning": "The move has meaningful strategic alignment with Services expansion and margin defense, but the $1.75-2.6B uplift only partially addresses the $4-5B regulatory exposure, making the impact modest relative to the stated problem. Feasibility is constrained by the unresolved dependency on successful product expansion (exclusive content, enhanced support infrastructure) and the risk that intensity-based tiering extracts margin from captive customers without proportional value differentiation\u2014a perception risk that could erode the 92% retention rate over time. Risk-adjusted return is weak because execution depends on a separate, high-complexity Services roadmap that has no guaranteed timeline or success probability."

      "impact": 5,
      "feasibility": 6,
      "risk_adjusted_return": 4,
      "strategic_alignment": 7,
      "reasoning": "The move has modest revenue impact ($500M-$1.2B net after churn, down from initial $1.75-2.6B projection) and is operationally feasible as a standard SaaS tiering model, but regulatory discovery risk and unknown churn elasticity materially erode the risk-adjusted return. Strategic alignment is strong if genuinely driven by product differentiation, but the original regulatory hedge rationale has been undermined by the critic's valid concerns about DMA exposure and margin defense motive detection."
