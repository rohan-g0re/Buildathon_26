*Reasoning:* The move has genuine strategic merit—enterprise markets grow faster than consumer, offer higher lifetime value, and leverage Apple's existing ecosystem strengths. However, the critic successfully exposed that execution feasibility is severely constrained by resource competition (if China requires significant product innovation) and that F2 provides no baseline enterprise revenue data to validate the opportunity scale. The phased approach I proposed mitigates but doesn't eliminate execution risk. Strategic alignment is strong because diversification away from consumer China is necessary, but risk-adjusted return remains moderate because the bet hinges on organizational transformation Apple has never attempted at scale, during a period of capital and management constraint.

## D2

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | 7/10 |
| Feasibility | 4/10 |
| Risk Adjusted Return | 4/10 |
| Strategic Alignment | 7/10 |
| **Subtotal** | **22/40** |

*Reasoning:* Enterprise diversification has genuine strategic merit (longer cycles, higher switching costs, Services leverage) and could materially shift Apple's revenue mix away from consumer cyclicality—but the critic correctly identified that the execution model as originally framed is not realistic. The move requires sequencing (stabilize China/India first) rather than parallel execution, which delays material impact and pushes payoff beyond 4-5 years. Feasibility is low because Apple cannot staff enterprise pilots without organizational friction during an acute China defense period, and the resource constraints are genuine physics, not solvable through hiring or governance restructuring. Risk-adjusted return is weak because the move accepts permanent near-term revenue loss (12% China contraction) while betting on an uncertain enterprise ramp that competitors have spent decades building. Strategic alignment is strong—enterprise *is* the right long-term direction—but timing and sequencing matter more than direction, and this proposal got the sequence wrong.

| Feasibility | 4/10 |
| Risk Adjusted Return | 5/10 |
| Strategic Alignment | 6/10 |
| **Subtotal** | **21/40** |

*Reasoning:* The enterprise pivot addresses a real structural risk in China (12% revenue contraction, sustained competitive displacement), but the critic's pressure exposed fatal flaws in execution timing and organizational fit. The organic build approach I initially defended is sunk-cost vulnerable and requires 4+ years to contribute meaningfully—unacceptable during a crisis period. My concession to an acquisition-based alternative is more credible but represents a different (and less ambitious) strategy than originally proposed. The move has strategic merit as a hedge against consumer China loss, but only if executed through acquisition rather than organic build, which materially reduces both impact and feasibility from my initial claims. Risk-adjusted return is mediocre because the upside (diversified revenue, enterprise margin stability) is offset by the execution risk of building new organizational capabilities during constrained capital periods, and the downside (sunk costs, distraction from core business, mid-tier talent acquisition) is real if consumer stabilization doesn't materialize by 2026.
