## UI CHANGES

1.  On the main analysis page, we have an analysis completed component, which is basically a part of the component beneath, but I really wanted to be a part of the status bar component. 

2. After the analysis is complete, we need maybe a view analysis button below all the four tiles that we have for all the four layers. Clicking on that will show a different view, and that view will basically have the leaderboard, but then clicking on every leaderboard entry we can see what was written in the move. You want to see the moves on the final analysis page.
    - Also, you can show that the top three moves, along with the scores. As we have these scores for all the four metrics, you can show a spider chart for them.
    - The top three moves, which are basically the top three highly scored moves, should be in the same visible colour, but the other moves section should be there, which basically shows the rest of the moves. They should be greyed out till then.


3. The panel that we are using for showing up the document text may be:
- the F1 and F2 documents
- the conversation view, which shows the complete negotiation chats between critique and decision makers in the sandbox  All of them are showing raw text. We have to see all the text in Markdown as it is coming in Markdown format, so all those viewing panels should be Markdown compatible.
